code is a way to fake the functionality of a normal SpeedController for
use in the OctoDriveSubsystem.

InternetConnecter. It represents and controlls the speed of one motor.
It is to be used as an input in a DifferentialDrive. It gives commands
to the InternetConnecter and the InternetConnecter sends them.
