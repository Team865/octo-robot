/// @brief SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor Command
///
/// Reference tutorial:  https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/
///
/// Fast commands on the robot currently have a latency of around 10us.
/// The speed of sound is 340 m/s, or 0.034 cm/us.  It's an echo sensor,
/// so the sound has to go out and back.
///
/// If t is the time to get the response, in us, the range in cm is
/// 
/// range = t * 0.034 / 2
/// 
/// Reversing this...
///
/// range * 2 = t * 0.034
/// t = range * 2 / 0.034
///
/// The sensor has a range of 2cm to 100cm, so the expected wait time for a
/// response is between 117 us and 5882 us.
///
/// The upper end is a lot - we can't block while we're waiting for a response.
/// We'll schedule ourselves for a 20ms update while we wait for the sensor
/// to respond.  If we actually get called every 20ms the accuracy of the 
/// sensor will be about +.68 cm.  That might do.
///
/// If we do want more accuracy, another idea would be to do a course sensor
/// reading to get a general of the distance, and then do a fine sensor
/// reading that's a bit more blocking.
