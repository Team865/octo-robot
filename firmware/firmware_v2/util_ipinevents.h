/// @brief Record changes in an input, and the time the change occured
///
/// This class records changes that occur on a single GPIO pin, and the time
/// the change occured at.
///
/// - Interrupt occurs because a GPIO pin changes state
///   - An interrupt handler is called
///   - The interrupt handler gets the time
///   - The interrupt handler gets the current state of the pin
///   - The interrupt handler records that information in IPinEvents  
///   - The interrupt handler exits
///
/// Use Example:  Encoder
/// 
/// - The Encoder Command's execute() method is called
///   - execute() looks at the IpinEvents for the two pins the encoder owns
///   - execute() computes the current encoder state using the pin changes
///   - execute() figures out the speed the encoder is moving from event times
///
/// The last job, "execute() figures out the speed the encoder is moving from
/// from event times", is the reason we need the extra complexity of interrupt
/// driven IO.  With polling we know that a pin state occured, but not 
/// precisely when it occured.
///
/// Here is background reading on using interrupts:  https://randomnerdtutorials.com/interrupts-timers-esp8266-arduino-ide-nodemcu/
///
/// The guidance on that tutorial says that the interrupt should be quick and
/// update a global variable.  That's more or less the approach that we'll
/// take.  An IpinEvents will be a true singleton, in that there will only be
/// a single instance for each class definition.
